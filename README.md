# Molecule-Optimization-Using-SMILES-Representation
Using Computational Intelligence Techniques to enhance molecule optimisation - represented in SMILES - to bind with target molecules.

#### Problem Statement ####

This research investigates the application of computational intelligence techniques for molecular optimization, using SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) representations. The study focuses on evolving molecular structures that exhibit improved chemical properties through interaction with a defined environment or by enhancing binding affinity to a target molecule (molecular docking). The system is also designed to explore the potential of jointly optimizing molecules for both environmental interaction and target binding, aiming to discover compounds with balanced and desirable biochemical behaviors.
